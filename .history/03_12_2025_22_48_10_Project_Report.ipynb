    "## Introduction: \n",
    "For this project, we are analyzing data collected by researchers in Computer Science at UBC. They have set up a MineCraft server that allows them to record consenting players’ behaviour and characteristics for study. In particular, we want to answer the question: **What players' `Age`, `gender`, and `played_hours` can best predict whether they would `subscribe` to a gaming newsletter, and how does it differ from players `experience`?** In this project, we will focus on the `players.csv` dataset, as it is of most use to us to answer our question. The `players.csv` set contains 196 observations and 7 variables. This data is already in its tidy form because every column is a single variable, every row is a single observation, and every cell is a single value.  We can see that there are three types of variables here: character, logical, and double. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Character Variables:**\n",
    "\n",
    "`hashedEmail` (email of player that has been converted into a unique string of characters, for privacy)\n",
    "\n",
    "`name` (first name of player)\n",
    "\n",
    "`gender` (gender of player)\n",
    "\n",
    "`experience` (skill level of player)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Double Variables:**\n",
    "\n",
    "`played_hours` (number of hours spent on the game by each player)\n",
    "\n",
    "`Age` (age in years of each player)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Logical variable:**\n",
    "\n",
    "`subscribe` (whether or not the player is subscribed to the game newsletter) \n",
    "\n",
    "For our question, we want to know if a player's age, gender, and amount of played hours can determine if they will subscribe to the game newsletter or not. We chose these three predictor variables because they are all characteristics of each individual player that can allow us to group them and determine which type of player is most likely to subscribe. Additionally, we want to determine if any difference in experience across players will be a factor in whether or not a player is subscribed.\n",
    "\n",
    "A potential issue with this data under the `played_hours` variable, we can see that many players have 0 hours played. This could cause weird results when we begin to wrangle. Furthermore, some values under the `gender` variable contain very little sample sizes, making it hard to scale these categories. "
